## Configuration

Before using the Exercises API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme)

---

## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme)

The Exercises API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/exercises](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/exercises?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```javascript
const exercisesAPI = require('@apiverve/exercises');
const api = new exercisesAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

---

## Usage

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
var query = {
  muscle: "chest",
  name: "barbell",
  equipment: "barbell"
};

api.execute(query, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
var query = {
  muscle: "chest",
  name: "barbell",
  equipment: "barbell"
};

api.execute(query)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    var query = {
  muscle: "chest",
  name: "barbell",
  equipment: "barbell"
};

    try {
        const data = await api.execute(query);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```

          "While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs.",

          "Slowly roll the barbell straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.",
          "After a second pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times."

          "From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.",
