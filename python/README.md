## Installation

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install apiverve-exercises
```

Using `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install apiverve-exercises
```

## Configuration

Before using the exercises API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com?utm_source=pypi&utm_medium=readme)

---

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started quickly:

```python
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }

try:
    # Make the API call
    result = api.execute(query)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

---

## Usage

The Exercises API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/exercises](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/exercises?utm_source=pypi&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```python
# Import the client module
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")
```

---

## Perform Request

Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```python
query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }
```

###### Simple Request

```python
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```json

          "While keeping a slight arch on your back, lift your hips and roll the barbell towards your feet as you exhale. Tip: As you perform the movement, your glutes should be coming up, you should be keeping the abs tight and should maintain your back posture at all times. Also your arms should be staying perpendicular to the floor throughout the movement. If you don't, you will work out your shoulders and back more than the abs.",
          "After a second contraction at the top, start to roll the barbell back forward to the starting position slowly as you inhale.",

          "Slowly roll the barbell straight forward, stretching your body into a straight position. Tip: Go down as far as you can without touching the floor with your body. Breathe in during this portion of the movement.",
          "After a second pause at the stretched position, start pulling yourself back to the starting position as you breathe out. Tip: Go slowly and keep your abs tight at all times."

          "From the starting position, breathe in and begin coming down slowly until the bar touches your middle chest.",

          "While keeping the upper arms stationary, curl the weight up as high as you can while squeezing the biceps. Breathe out as you perform this portion of the movement. Tip: Only the forearms should move. Do not swing the arms.",
          "After a second contraction, slowly go back to the starting position as you inhale. Tip: Make sure that you go all of the way down.",

}
```

## Error Handling

The API client provides comprehensive error handling through the `ExercisesAPIClientError` exception. Here are some examples:

### Basic Error Handling

```python
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient, ExercisesAPIClientError

api = ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }

try:
    result = api.execute(query)
    print("Success!")
    print(result)
except ExercisesAPIClientError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e.message}")
    if e.status_code:
        print(f"Status Code: {e.status_code}")
    if e.response:
        print(f"Response: {e.response}")
```

### Handling Specific Error Types

```python
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient, ExercisesAPIClientError

api = ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }

try:
    result = api.execute(query)

    # Check for successful response
    if result.get('status') == 'success':
        print("Request successful!")
        print(result.get('data'))
    else:
        print(f"API returned an error: {result.get('error')}")

except ExercisesAPIClientError as e:
    # Handle API client errors
    if e.status_code == 401:
        print("Unauthorized: Invalid API key")
    elif e.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit exceeded")
    elif e.status_code >= 500:
        print("Server error - please try again later")
    else:
        print(f"API error: {e.message}")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    print(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
```

### Using Context Manager (Recommended)

The client supports the context manager protocol for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient, ExercisesAPIClientError

query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }

# Using context manager ensures proper cleanup
with ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]") as api:
    try:
        result = api.execute(query)
        print(result)
    except ExercisesAPIClientError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e.message}")
# Session is automatically closed here
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed request and response information:

```python
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient

# Enable debug mode
api = ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]", debug=True)

query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }

# Debug information will be printed to console
result = api.execute(query)
```

### Manual Session Management

If you need to manually manage the session lifecycle:

```python
from apiverve_exercises.apiClient import ExercisesAPIClient

api = ExercisesAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

try:
    query = { "muscle": "chest", "name": "barbell", "equipment": "barbell" }
    result = api.execute(query)
    print(result)
finally:
    # Manually close the session when done
    api.close()
```
